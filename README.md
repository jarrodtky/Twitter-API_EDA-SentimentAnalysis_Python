## Project Overview
- Use social media analytics to extract tweets from a user or by keywords and perform sentiment and text analysis to discover online text patterns shared between users on Twitter.
- Use the ipynb code to scrape the desired data into a dataset.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is used to assist this project with Data Mining by extracting important insights using: 
  - [Basic Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics)
  - [Data Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization)
  - [Supervised Machine Learning Models (Classification)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning)
    - [Multinomial Naive Bayes Classier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)

===============================

## Motivation
- In the healthcare industry, understanding what factors or indicators affect a disease is an essential part of the decision-making and problem-solving process. 
- People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model or statistical analyses can be of great help.
- These indicators allow decision-makers to identify any potential ways to reduce risk factors of future health and increase the likelihood of disease prevention effectively (Santos et al., 2019). 



### Aim & Objective
- Aim: 
  - To improve the process of analyzing patientsâ€™ heart disease in the healthcare industry to allow earlier detection and avoidance of heart disease and morbidity. 
- Objective: 
  - To create and select the best Machine Learning model that classifies patients into those who will develop heart disease in the future and those who will not based on the importance of data variables and models evaluation and assessment (i.e. Accuracy, Recall, AUC, etc.). 
  - The insights gained by analyzing the feature importance of each data variable to the target data will aid in establishing which factor or indicator is critical in causing heart disease.



## Contents
**(1) HeartDisease_Dataset.csv**
  - Heart Disease dataset file in CSV format.

**(2) HeartDisease_EDA-ML_Python.ipynb**
  - The main notebook containing the Python implementation codes (along with explanations) for the project.
