## Project Overview
- Use social media analytics to extract tweets from a user or by keywords and perform sentiment and text analysis to discover online text patterns shared between users on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login?lang=en).
- Use the ipynb code to scrape the desired data into a dataset.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is used to assist this project with Data Mining by extracting important insights using: 
  - [Basic Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics)
  - [Data Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization)
  - [Sentiment Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis)
  - [Supervised Machine Learning Models (Classification)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning)
    - [Multinomial Naive Bayes Classier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)



## Motivation
- Nowadays Twitter is used to disseminate general or scientific findings to the public.
- So it is important to understand tweet authors’ citation motivations and attitudes (or sentiments) towards the most discussed content or trends.
- Furthermore, Twitter allows businesses to engage personally with consumers. 
- However, there’s so much data on Twitter that it can be hard for brands to prioritize which tweets or mentions to respond to first.


### Aim & Objective
- Aim: 
  - To understand how the content users share on Twitter by analyzing which Tweets organically get the most impressions, engagement, and trends by users or via keywords.
- Objective: 
  - To determine the contents and trends shared by users.
  - To analyze the sentiments and impressions shared between users or via topic/keywords.
  - To create a Machine Learning model that classifies the tweets between users or topic/keywords based on the text sentiments, models evaluation, and assessment (i.e. Accuracy, Recall, AUC, etc.). 
  - The insights gained by analyzing the tweets data will aid in understanding the content, engagement, and trends between users.
